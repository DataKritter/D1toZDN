This pair of R shiny scripts creates a Shiny App (runable from within R Studio or on shinyapps.io for free) that imports a specific file format (Dairy One Labs -29 format, example provided) and converts it from "wide" to "long". This allows it to be imported into Zoo Diet NaviGator (https://zoodiets.com), and MS Access application.
